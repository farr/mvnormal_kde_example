# Examples of Using a KDE Approximation to the Likelihood for a Gaussian (sub)Population

Some examples for Ethan of using a KDE over a subset of dimensions to
approximate the likelihood function; when the population in these dimensions is
Gaussian, then the marginalization integral can be done analytically, resulting
in speedups and exploiting that the KDE approximation is smooth even for very
narrow populations.
